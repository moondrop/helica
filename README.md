## About
Helica is an incredibly fast and highly performant web framework made for rapid development of RESTful APIs and minimalistic server-side rendered web applications. 

While many other web frameworks for Node.js are *already* very fast in themselves, they're inherently bottlenecked by using the native Node.js HTTP server. Helica is built on top of a [custom HTTP server](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js/) written entirely in C++ in conjunction with highly optimized v8 bindings. This translates to **up to 300% the speed** of the native Node.js HTTP server excluding the use of any framework and **up to 500% the speed** of popular solutions like Express.

A full benchmarking suite including exact results and code used can be found [here](/benchmark).

## Installing
```
❯ npm install helica
```
> **Warning!** <br /> Installing Helica via Yarn is **not supported** as Yarn lacks the capability of forwarding SIGINT events to the underlying process thus breaking graceful shutdowns!

## Getting Started Example:

```js
const Helica = require('helica');
const app = new Helica.Server({ sslApp: false, debug: true });

class HelloWorld {
    get(response, request) {
        response.end('Hello World!');
    }
}

app.addResource('/', HelloWorld);
app.run();
```
